Report: https://www.overleaf.com/project/627a060667407830d791e481  

This is a project done in the context the course **COMP5214 - Advanced Deep Learning Architecture** by **Prof. Qifeng Chen** in Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.

The final code is given along with the bash script to run the evaluation, but the path to data might need to be modified accordingly. We left the draft notebooks used to explore different aspects in this project as well
