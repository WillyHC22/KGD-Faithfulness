This is a project done in the context the course **COMP5214 - Advanced Deep Learning Architecture** by **Prof. Qifeng Chen** in Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.

In this project, we investigate methods to improve the faithfulness of knowledge-grounded dialogue systems in few-shot settings without parameter updates, and evaluate the robustness of a recently proposed model-based metric, Q2, to assess the factual faithfulness of dialogue generation in a QG-QA setting, without relying on the underlying language model used to perform the task.
